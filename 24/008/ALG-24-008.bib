  abstract = {This report presents algorithms for generating small random samples without replacement. It considers two cases. It presents an algorithm for sampling a pair of distinct integers, and an algorithm for sampling a triple of distinct integers. The worstcase runtime of both algorithms is constant, while the worstcase runtime of common algorithms for the general case of sampling $k$ elements from a set of $n$ are linear in $n$. Java implementations of both algorithms are included in the open source library $\rho\mu$.}
