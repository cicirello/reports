  abstract = {This technical report is a data supplement to ``An Analysis of an Open Source Binomial Random Variate Generation Algorithm'' published in ASEC 2023. The dataset concerns the acceptance-rejection iterations of an algorithm for generating binomial random variates. This report includes additional experimental data that was excluded from the original ASEC 2023 paper in the interests of brevity. The source code of the experiments that produced the data is open source and available via GitHub.}
